(ns os-messaging.app
  "etzhayyim-wasm-os-messaging-0sm3sg01 appview — reagent + re-frame, view built
  from jp-go-dds (デジタル庁デザインシステム) hiccup.

  Faithful port of the previous SvelteKit scaffold's status page
  (`svelte/src/routes/+page.svelte`, ~84 lines): a static display of this
  Worker's own declared surface — title / project / kind, route count +
  list, wrangler var keys, an XRPC-enabled flag, and its own source path.
  Every field below mirrors the constant `app` object `+page.svelte` held
  in its <script> block; nothing here is invented and nothing is
  simplified away.

  Two fields are updated, not simplified, to stay honest about what this
  migration itself changed:

  - `:app/relative-path` now names this file, not the deleted Svelte one.
  - `:app/xrpc?` flips from `true` to `false`, and for a load-bearing
    reason, not a cosmetic one. Before this migration, the deployed Worker
    (`wrangler.jsonc` `main: svelte/.svelte-kit/cloudflare/_worker.js`) was
    the SvelteKit adapter build, whose XRPC handler was
    `svelte/src/routes/xrpc/[...path]/+server.ts` (moved, not deleted, to
    `src/xrpc-proxy.ts` — see that file's header; it proxies to
    `AGENTGATEWAY_MCP_ROUTER_URL` and is NOT wired into this migration's
    wrangler.jsonc). After this migration, `wrangler.jsonc` has NO `main`
    key at all: `src/app.ts` (this repo's `@etzhayyim/kotodama-host-sdk`
    actor facade — its NSID commands like
    `com.etzhayyim.apps.osMessaging.webhookDiscord`) never calls
    `env.ASSETS.fetch(...)`, so — per this migration's own rule — it was
    NOT repointed as `main` (a Worker sitting in front of the assets that
    never falls through to them would mean nothing serves this bundle).
    Unlike the gmail appview's `src/app.ts`, which already called
    `env.ASSETS.fetch` as its fallback branch before its migration touched
    anything, this repo's `src/app.ts` was never wired to this
    `wrangler.jsonc` deploy target in the first place — this app's
    `kotodama.jsonld` names a `component.path` of `component.wasm`, i.e.
    `src/app.ts` is compiled/run as a separate actor component elsewhere,
    not as this Cloudflare Worker's `main`. So after this migration, this
    specific deploy target (the assets-only Worker `wrangler.jsonc`
    describes) serves no XRPC route at all — `:app/xrpc?` reports that
    honestly as `false` rather than repeating the old Svelte constant.

  `public/index.html`'s inlined <style> was produced once, at authoring
  time, by `jp-go-dds.page/->page` running on the JVM (via this deps.edn's
  jp-go-dds git/sha), concatenating the vendored `dds.css` with
  `jp-go-dds.core/ext-css` — exactly what `jp-go-dds.page/page` composes
  for its own <style> block. This namespace only requires
  `jp-go-dds.core` — the browser bundle does not need `jp-go-dds.page` or
  `html.core` at runtime; those are JVM-only tools used to author the
  static shell once. Regenerate that shell (e.g. if jp-go-dds's core
  components or ext-rules change) with:

    (require '[jp-go-dds.page :as page] '[clojure.java.io :as io])
    (spit \"public/index.html\"
          (page/->page {:title \"etzhayyim-project-os-messaging\"
                         :lang \"ja\"
                         :description \"os-messaging — etzhayyim OS Messaging Gateway appview facade status page (reagent + re-frame + jp-go-dds).\"
                         :css (slurp (io/resource \"jp_go_dds/dds.css\"))}
                        [:div {:id \"app\"} \"etzhayyim-project-os-messaging loading…\"]
                        [:script {:src \"js/app.js\"}]))"
  (:require [reagent.dom :as rdom]
            [re-frame.core :as rf]
            [jp-go-dds.core :as dds]))
